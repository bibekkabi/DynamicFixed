# DynamicFixed
A Dynamic Fixed-point Arithmetic Library in C/C++ 

This is a fixed-point arithmetic library for 32-bit wordlength. 

It's purpose is to compute the data dynamic range during run-time and assign the appropriate integer wordlength for the fixed-point implementation.

We have an example of fixed-point implementation of Lanczos based tridiagonalization algorithm using the dynamic fixed-point library.

It is a part of the published work:
Pradhan, Tapan, Bibek Kabi, Ramanarayan Mohanty, and Aurobinda Routray. "Development of numerical linear algebra algorithms in dynamic fixed‚Äêpoint format: a case study of Lanczos tridiagonalization." International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications 44, no. 6 (2016): 1222-1262.

# Project Showcase
The file Fixed_dyn.cpp has all the arithmetic operations for 32-bit fixed-point format.
